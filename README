This is a shiny application for estimating one's base calorie
needs based on personal information provided. It uses
one of two methods depending on how much information you provide.
See the pitch at:
   http://rpubs/adjog/calestpitch
for more details.

The application is hosted at shinyapps.io, so you can
go to:
    https://adjog.shinyapps.io/CalEst
to run it.

Enter your personal information including gender (tick box),
weight (slider box), and age and height (numeric entries).
The units are shown on the page, although note carefully that
height is in feed (so 6.1 is 6.1 feet, not 6 foot 1 inch).
Enter the % of your body mass that is fat if you know it; otherwise
leave as blank or 0. Percent body fat is the only optional entry, and a more accurate method is used if you provide this value.
